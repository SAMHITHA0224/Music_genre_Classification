Project Description :

1)We all know that there are hundreds of music genres and millions of songs in each zone are music joiner classic classifier uses machine learning techniques
and gives an approach to classify the music automatically by providing tax to the songs present in the users library library

2)To automatically classify different music Jonas we will require a database and an algorithm

3)In music joiner classification we use the GRZAN data set Which is a collection of around thousand audio files with 30 seconds duration each and 10 classes where data is classified accordingly The GTZAN Data set is the most used public data set
for evaluation in machine learning research GTZAN Has audio tracks of similar size and similar frequency range this data is it also provides a meta data 
that allows the users to experiment without dealing with feature extraction

3)Music joiner classification explores both neural networks and traditional method of using machine learning algorithms such as KNN
KNN is one of the simplest classified is one of the easy to implement. In KNN The genre of the music sample is classified by the most common class office K nearest neighbour. KNN Is the supervised technique that uses the data point and calculate the distance between K number of labelled data points. 
It has makes predictions on data points based on their similarity measure that is distance between them and the KNN uses account of K as five
